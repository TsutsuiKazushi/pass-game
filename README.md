## Experimental setup and models

 (left) Triangular passing task. Three attackers attempted to maintain possession against a single defender, while the defender attempted to intercept. (center) Attacker model. The attacking agents followed heuristic rules such as passing to the wider angle and maintaining viable passing lanes for teammates. (right) Defender model. The defensive agent was trained using deep reinforcement learning to intercept passes.

## Examples
<img width="600" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/51cd5cad-1efc-49a6-a8c5-a0de9841a884" />

The videos are examples for each experimental condition. Each row varies the ball speed: slow (bottom), medium (middle), fast (top). Each column varies the defender speed: slow (left), medium (center), fast (right).
